# Introduction 
TODO: 
Console App:

We need an electronic grade book to read the scores of an individual student 
and then compute some simple statistics from the scores.
The grades are entered as floating point numbers from 0 to 100, and the statistics should show
us the highest grade, the lowest grade and the average grade.


Some steps

1) given a collection of grades, we need to show the average grade in a console application

2) add some class for the grade Book

3) compute lowest grade, highest grade and average grade in main Program

4) move computation code to the Book class but first create a Statistics class to hold the low, high, average grade

5) instead of hard coding the grades use Console.Readline to ask the user  to repeatedly provide grades 
from the console and only stop reading the input if he presses the letter "q"
*Make sure to parse the string into numbers before doing calculations
